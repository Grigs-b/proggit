# Proggit Projects
(soon to be) Collection of personal projects. Based on the projects that can be found at [/r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer).

Started these for a challenge and to improve my coding in various languages

## Current Projects
1. [Words with Enemies](https://github.com/Grigs-b/proggit/tree/master/198)
    - Written in Go
    - Human v. Human v1.0
    - Bot Support v1.0! Easy Medium and Hard bots.

###Known Issues - Words with Enemies v1.0
1. Bug where a user can run out of vowels and be unable to complete words. Due to the fact your hand is currently just 12 random letters rather than, say a Scrabble distribution, it's possible to run out of vowels and be unable to complete words.
